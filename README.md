❄️ LED Snowflake Decorative Light

📌 Overview

This project is a snowflake-shaped decorative LED light powered by a NE555 timer IC.
Designed with bright blue LEDs arranged in a symmetrical snowflake pattern, it creates a visually pleasing blinking effect, making it perfect for home decoration, festivals, and DIY electronic art projects.

✨ Features

- Snowflake-inspired design ❄️ for a stylish and modern look

- 30 high-brightness blue LEDs arranged symmetrically

- Blinking effect controlled by a NE555 timer circuit

- Powered by a 9V battery for portability

- Durable copper wire frame

🔧 How It Works

- The NE555 timer IC is configured in astable mode to continuously generate pulses.

- These pulses turn the LEDs ON and OFF at a set interval.

- A capacitor and resistor network connected to the NE555 determines the blinking speed.

- The LEDs are mounted on a snowflake-shaped copper frame, distributing light evenly for a pleasing effect.
